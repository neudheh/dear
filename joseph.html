	<h1><strong>Dear Joseph...</strong></h1>
	<p>
		You are a great class chairperson and friend, and I appreciate you for 
		that. On top of juggling your studies, your CCA, your role as a class chair
		and your social life, you still had to deal with my bs. You were very patient
		with me, even when I made you really angry. The chats we have during recess, 
		the laughs we share and your jokes, I will treasure them. You are a really 
		hard-working, really really really talented person, and I can't wait to see what 
		you will do in the future. All the best for O Levels, and I hope you can get
		into the school you want!
